# Zillow House Price Prediction

Hey there! This is my project where I built a machine learning model to predict house prices using Zillow's data.

## What's This All About?

I took Zillow's housing dataset and used it to create a model that can predict property values. 
The main goal? Figure out what makes house prices go up or down, and make decent predictions about their values.

## 🛠️ What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Fixed up missing values (there were quite a few!)
   - Got rid of outliers that would mess up our predictions
   - Dropped columns that weren't really useful

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Made some neat visualizations using Matplotlib
   - Created correlation heatmaps to see which features matter most
   - Looked for patterns in how different things affect house prices

3. **Model Building**
   - Used Linear Regression (keeping it simple but effective!)
   - Standardized the features so everything's on the same scale
   - Engineered some features to make the predictions better

## 📊 The Code

The main stuff you'll find here:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)
- Feature selection (getting rid of highly correlated features)
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization code for understanding the data better

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas (for data wrangling)
- NumPy (for number crunching)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for making things pretty)
- Scikit-learn (for the actual machine learning bits)

## 📈 Results

The model does a decent job at predicting house values! Here are the key metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.070
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 2.995
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.027


## 📝 Notes

This is a learning project, so the model might not be perfect for real-world predictions. But it's a cool way to understand how different factors affect house prices :)
